            1. Information We Collect <br>

            We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our Site, subscribe to the newsletter, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features, or resources we make available on our Site.

            Information You Provide to Us:

            Newsletter Subscription: When you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your name, age and email address.

            Message Form: When you send us a message, we collect your name, email address, and any information you choose to provide in your message.

            Donation Information: While we do not directly collect payment information on our Site, if you choose to donate to <abbr title="Lineage Media Group">LMG</abbr> via a GoFundMe campaign or directly to our PayPal account, these third-party platforms (GoFundMe, PayPal) will collect your payment details and certain personal information. We may receive information about your donation (e.g., your name, email, donation amount) from these platforms, but not your financial details directly.

            Automatically Collected Information (Server Logs): As is common with most websites, our website server (hosted on GitHub) automatically collects certain non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. This information may include the browser name, the type of computer or device, and technical information about Users' means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system, the Internet service providers utilized, and other similar information (e.g., IP addresses). This data is typically used for basic website operation, security, and traffic analysis.

            Cookies: Our Site uses only those cookies that are strictly necessary for the technical functionality of the website and its forms (e.g., session cookies to manage form submissions). We do not use cookies for advertising, user preference tracking, or persistent user tracking.
        </p>

            For Organization Updates and Donor Outreach: We may use your contact information to send you updates about our non-profit's activities, impact, and fundraising initiatives.

            For Internal Record-Keeping: To keep track of users who have signed up for our services (newsletter, message responses, donor engagement).

            To Improve Our Site: We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services.
